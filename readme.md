# A command line utility to inject css and js files into an html file or to remove code based on conditions.
Inspired by [gulp-inject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-inject) and [gulp-remove-code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-remove-code) and written because I could not find a command-line equivalent that could work with npm scripts instead of gulp.

This module injects css and javascript files between markers placed in an html file or removes code between markers.
It can take a single file or a directory of files which will be transformed to strings and injected.
It removes code between markers so you can for example remove livereload code which is not needed in a production environment.
As well as removing code it can keep code between markers so you can had environment specific code such as Sentry which is not needed in development or SIT environments. 
It can also inject the current git commit hash into the HTML as a comment so it is easily visible which commit is currently 
deployed.

**This module was written in ES6 and requires node >= 4.0.0.**

## Usage
Place the markers in your html file to inject or remove code:

```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Home</title>

     <!-- inject:css -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/styles.css">
     <!-- endinject -->

   </head>
   <body>

     <!-- inject:js -->
     <script src="/path/to/build.js"></script>
     <!-- endinject -->

     <!-- remove:production -->
     <script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
     <!-- endremove -->

     <!-- keep:production -->
     <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/4.4.2/bundle.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     <!-- endkeep -->

   </body>
   </html>
   <!-- inject:git-hash -->
```
The css and javascript files will be injected between the markers and the scripts and stylesheets that are already there will be removed.
This way you can replace the regular files used in a development environment with the built files (bundled, minified, versioned) in a production environment.

 Options:

    -h, --help             output usage information
    -V, --version          output the version number
    -i, --input <input>    Input file
    -o, --output <output>  Output file (defaults to input when omitted)
    -c, --css <css>        css file(s) to inject (file or directory). Wildcards can be used with quotation: '**/*.css'
    -j, --js <js>          js file(s) to inject (file or directory). Wildcards can be used with quotation: '**/*.js'
    -r, --remove <remove>  Remove and keep condition
    -g, --ignore <path>    Prefix to remove from the injected filenames
    -H, --hash             Inject git hash of current commit
    -e, --etag             Appends "?etag=fileHash" to every import (link, script) to avoid undesired caching in new deployments

### Examples

Given a directory:

```
-- dist
   -- css
      styles.1234abc.css
   -- js
      vendor.js
      build.4567def.js
```
`postbuild -i index.html -o dist/index.html -c dist/css -j dist/js -r production -H`

will result in the file `dist/index.html`:

```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Home</title>

     <!-- inject:css -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/styles.1234abc.css">
     <!-- endinject -->

   </head>
   <body>

     <!-- inject:js -->
     <script src="dist/js/vendor.js"></script>
     <script src="dist/js/build.4567def.js"></script>
     <!-- endinject -->

     <!-- keep:production -->
     <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/4.4.2/bundle.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     <!-- endkeep -->

   </body>
   </html>
   <!-- b64f022ae51d87a411c4608f403f3216ee028d03 -->
```

*Notice that the code*
```
     <!-- remove:production -->
     <script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
     <!-- endremove -->
```
*has been removed.*

*But the code*
```
     <!-- keep:production -->
     <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/4.4.2/bundle.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     <!-- endkeep -->
```
*has NOT been removed.*

*The comment*
```
    <!-- inject:git-hash -->
```
*has been replaced by the git hash of the current commit.*

Specifying a single file instead of a directory will only inject that single file:

`postbuild -i index.html -o dist/index.html -c dist/css -j dist/js/build.4567def.js -r production`

results in:

```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Home</title>

     <!-- inject:css -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/styles.1234abc.css">
     <!-- endinject -->

   </head>
   <body>

     <!-- inject:js -->
     <script src="dist/js/build.4567def.js"></script>
     <!-- endinject -->

     <!-- keep:production -->
     <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/4.4.2/bundle.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     <!-- endkeep -->

   </body>
   </html>
```

*Notice that `vendor.js` is not injected.*

If the -e, --etag is specified the output will be 

```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Home</title>

     <!-- inject:css -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/styles.1234abc.css?etag=e997365235369248a234b1c343ac41">
     <!-- endinject -->

   </head>
   <body>

     <!-- inject:js -->
     <script src="dist/js/build.4567def.js?etag=9fffaf9de332d9848ab34bbc3434d34341"></script>
     <!-- endinject -->

     <!-- keep:production -->
     <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/4.4.2/bundle.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     <!-- endkeep -->

   </body>
   </html>
```
